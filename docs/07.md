`window.nostr` capability for web browsers
------------------------------------------

`draft` `optional`

The `window.nostr` object may be made available by web browsers or extensions and websites or web-apps may make use of it after checking its availability.

That object must define the following methods:

```
async window.nostr.getPublicKey(): string // returns a public key as hex
async window.nostr.signEvent(event: { created_at: number, kind: number, tags: string[][], content: string }): Event // takes an event object, adds `id`, `pubkey` and `sig` and returns it
```

Aside from these two basic above, the following functions can also be implemented optionally:
```
async window.nostr.nip04.encrypt(pubkey, plaintext): string // returns ciphertext and iv as specified in nip-04 (deprecated)
async window.nostr.nip04.decrypt(pubkey, ciphertext): string // takes ciphertext and iv as specified in nip-04 (deprecated)
async window.nostr.nip44.encrypt(pubkey, plaintext): string // returns ciphertext as specified in nip-44
async window.nostr.nip44.decrypt(pubkey, ciphertext): string // takes ciphertext as specified in nip-44
```

### Recommendation to Extension Authors
To make sure that the `window.nostr` is available to nostr clients on page load, the authors who create Chromium and Firefox extensions should load their scripts by specifying `"run_at": "document_end"` in the extension's manifest.


### Implementation

## GitRepublic Usage

NIP-07 is the primary authentication method for GitRepublic. All user interactions that require signing events use the NIP-07 browser extension interface.

### Authentication Flow

1. **Availability Check**: GitRepublic checks for `window.nostr` availability on page load
2. **Public Key Retrieval**: When users need to authenticate, `getPublicKey()` is called to get their pubkey
3. **Event Signing**: All repository announcements, PRs, issues, and other events are signed using `signEvent()`

### Key Features

- **Repository Creation**: Users sign repository announcement events (kind 30617) using NIP-07
- **Repository Updates**: Settings changes, maintainer additions, and other updates are signed via NIP-07
- **Pull Requests**: PR creation and updates are signed by the PR author
- **Issues**: Issue creation and comments are signed by the author
- **Commit Signatures**: Git commits can be signed using NIP-07 (client-side only, keys never leave browser)

### Security

- Keys never leave the browser - all signing happens client-side
- No server-side key storage required
- Users maintain full control of their private keys

**Implementation**: `src/lib/services/nostr/nip07-signer.ts`
